objects are instances of a class. Every time I use the "new" keyword 
before the name constructor of a class, I am creating an object in memory, 
or an instance of that class used.

instaces as mentioned above, are instances or objects in memory of the 
class used to generate the instance/object. The words instance and object 
are used interchangeably.

Class can be seen as a blueprint. Using the class I can generate/create 
many instances of that class as I like or objects.

Reference can be seen as an address or a reference to the object in memory 
created for the class. Reference is a pointer that contains the address 
where that object was stored in memory.
