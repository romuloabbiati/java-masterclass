- meals are composed of 3 items: burger, drink and side
- the app lets Bill select the type of burger and some of the additional 
items or extras that can be added to the burgers; as well as the actual 
pricing
- the meal order should be composed of exactly: 1 burger, 1 drink & 1 side
- the most common meal order should be created without any arguments: 
regular burger, small coke and small fries
- I should be able to create other meal orders, by specifying different 
burgers, drinks and side item (fries or salad)

DRINK & SIDE ITEM
- DRINK: should have at least type (coke, coke zero, orange juice), size 
and price. The price should change for each size
- SIDE: it needs at least a type and price

BURGER:
- burger type, base price and up to max of 3 extra toppings
- the constructor should include only the burger type and price
- extra toppings on a burger need to be added somehow, and priced 
according to their type

THE DELUXE BURGER BONUS
- create a deluxe burger meal with a deluxe burger, that has a set price, 
so that any additional toppings do not change the price
- the deluxe burger should have room for an additional 2 toppings

THE CODE:
- Create a default meal that uses the no-args constructor
- create a meal with a deluxe burger, where all items, drink, side item 
and toppings up to 5 extra toppings are included in the burger price

FOR EACH MEAL ORDER, I'LL WANT TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS:
- add some additional toppings to the burger
- change the size of the drink
- print the itemized list. This should include the price of the burger, 
any extra toppings, the drink price based on size, and the side item 
price
- print the total due amount for the meal
