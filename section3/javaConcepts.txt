Keywords: Keywords are words that were predefined in Java code that we 
cannot use it.

Variable: it's a data container that holds a value of some data type

Data type: In Java every information has a data type like string, integer, 
double, etc

Expressions: it's a coding construct, that evaluates to a single value. 
It's the right part of the code after the = sign.

Primitive Data Type: byte, short long, int  / char / boolean / float, 
double

Wrapper classes: Byte, Short, Long, Integer / Character / Boolean / Float, 
Double

Integer/int: occupies 32 bits in memory and can store numbers from 
-2147483648 to 2147483647

Byte/byte: occupies 8 bits in memory and can store numbers from -128 to 
127

Short/short: occupies 16 bits in memory and can sotre numbers from -32768 
to 32767

Long/long: has a width of 64 bits and can store number from 
-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

String: The string created with class String is considered immutable in a 
sense that when I concatenate a string with another string, instead of 
Java append the second part to the new string, it actually creates another 
string with both parts or strings and then place this new string in the 
variable created. The original string will be discarded. Because of this 
behaviour, if a code there are a lot of handling of strings, with 
concatenations so on and so forth, this might cause some performance 
issues, i.e. inefficiency, and then Java provides another class that 
address this issue. The name of the class is StringBuilder.
Although the StringBuilder class does not have the special features that 
the Java class possess.

Abbreviating operators: 
there are 2 ways to abbreviate operators post-fix increment/decrement 
operator or compound assignment operator
post-fix incremente/decrement operator: result++; or result--;
compound assignment operator: result += 1; or result -= 1;
